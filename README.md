# Sorting
A visual sorting program using Pygame to learn about and visualize different sorting algorithms
still under construction!

Requires Pygame to run

Features:
- shuffle
- pause operation
- bubble sort
- quicksort [needs work]
- counting sort (base 2)
- counting sort (base 10)

in progress
- Radix sort
- more to come

instructions:
1. upon loading you should see a warm colored triangle
2. press [S] now (or at any time) to pause any sorting and shuffle the items
   shuffling will eventually stop on its own but [S] can be pressed again to stop prematurely
3. after shuffling you can now press any of the folling keys to initiate the sorting:
- [Q] quicksort
- [B] bubblesort
- [2] counting sort (base 2)
- [C] counting sort (base 10)
after the list is sorted the algorithm will stop 
4. at any time press [P] to pause current operation

at any point during any process press [E] to enable step mode, 
 further pressing [P] while step mode is enabled will perform a single step of the current operation
 useful for debug
